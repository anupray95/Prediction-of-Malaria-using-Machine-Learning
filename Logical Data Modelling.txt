Logical data modelling
=========================
In our project we don't use any type of databases.
Instead of db we use excel files in .xlsx format.

In our project the columns present are:

1.Year
2.District
3.MalariaPatient
4.Percent
5.Cummulative

In rows there is different years:

1.2012
2.2013
3.2014
4.2015
5.2016

Note:- You can use other datasets but the column name must be exactly same.
